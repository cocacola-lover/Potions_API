# Building simple API for Potion Manager project.

## In development. Don't forget : 
    1. In main directory there supposed to be "database_info.json" like : 
    {
        "host" : "localhost",
        "user" : "root",
        "password" : "1234",
        "database" : "potions"
    }

    2. You should run "npm install" to load node_modules both in "/database" and "/API"
